# GideonOS 🚀
**Rust-powered AI Operating System for Clustered Intelligence**

GideonOS is a futuristic AI-driven operating system built in Rust, designed for running across multi-node clusters. It features real-time AI communication, modular kernel design, and native memory and task scheduling systems.

## 🌐 Key Components
- `gideonos-core`: Main interface and boot logic
- `gideonos-kernel`: Handles memory, process, and task management
- `gideonos-ai`: Modular AI brain with physics & NLP reasoning
- `gideonos-cluster`: Node discovery and communication protocols

## 🧠 Features
- Rust-based kernel performance
- AI physics engine and brain module
- Real-time speech interaction
- Cluster deployment across old machines

## 📦 Requirements
- Rust & Cargo
- Basic hardware (x86_64)
- Multi-node setup (for cluster features)

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
cargo build
cargo run -p gideonos-core

👥 Team & Skill Sets Needed
To build and scale GideonOS, our Rust-powered AI Operating System for distributed clusters, we are assembling a high-impact team of contributors with expertise in the following areas:

🧠 AI/ML & Cognitive Systems
Neural network architectures

Knowledge graphs & inference engines

Natural language understanding (NLU)

Real-time audio processing & TTS/ASR (e.g., Vosk, Coqui, Whisper)

🦀 Systems Programming (Rust)
Operating system architecture (kernel/user mode separation)

Memory management, schedulers, and concurrency

Writing safe, performant code using Rust

Interfacing with hardware and embedded systems (optionally via no_std)

🖥️ Cluster & Network Engineers
Multi-node computing and task orchestration (e.g., MPI, custom protocols)

High-performance messaging (e.g., ZeroMQ, gRPC, custom TCP)

Load balancing, containerization, and fault tolerance

📦 DevOps & CI/CD
GitHub Actions and Rust toolchain management

Cross-platform builds (e.g., WASM, Linux, embedded targets)

Deployment scripts for local clusters (Docker, Ansible, Nix)

🧪 QA & Security
Fuzz testing for memory safety and runtime errors

OS-level sandboxing and permission control

Secure boot, encrypted memory, and anti-tampering

🎨 UX, Branding & Documentation
UI/UX for voice-controlled or terminal interfaces

Documentation site generation (e.g., mdBook, Docusaurus)

Voice persona design (if conversational front-end is present)

Presentation and video asset creation (branding and outreach)
